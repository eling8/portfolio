                            We approach the task of named entity recognition (NER) for Chinese by representing each entity with a composition of its traits: the token-entity, its characters, and its characters’ main radicals. Character and radical-level information for each entity are included to provide additional relationships that might not be strictly captured within a token-entity’s word embedding during training. We learn using neural networks that are some combination of the following traits: unidirectional or bidirectional; single or multi-layer; simple, gated recurrent unit (GRU), or long short term memory (LSTM) celled. We achieve a maximum not-O token-level F1 score of 76 and entity-level F1 of 70.

                            NER is a task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that is concerned with taking an input sentence and identifying entities in the text which fall into categories such as PERSON, ORGANIZATION, and LOCATION. Most NER efforts have been focused on classifying entities in English sentences, while other languages have had less focus. This project seeks to further explore NER for the Chinese written language.

                            There are key differences between the Chinese and English languages. Chinese entities are composed of 50,000 characters, unlike English entities which are composed of 26 letters. Each Chinese character holds intrinsic meaning, but also embodies and contributes to a wide variety of meanings depending on which entity it is part of and its surrounding context. This differs from English, as the letter ”c” by itself holds no intrinsic meaning. Additionally, obvious English features used in NER such as word capitalization do not exist in Chinese. The Chinese written language also does not contain spaces between entities, so word segmentation is an additional challenge. Thus, imperfect segmentation techniques must be performed on datasets before NER-work, adding another layer of difficulty.

                        <p>
                            An additional feature we have decided to include that is specific to the Chinese language is each character’s main radical. A radical is a sub-part of a character. There are 214 radicals, which were identified historically by the Qing Emperor Kangxi; today, radicals are used as the basis for Chinese dictionary indexing. Radicals help to convey additional meaning behind each character. Take for example, the characters 食 (food), 餓 (hungry), 飯 (rice), and 餐 (meal). All of these characters have the main radical 食 and are related to food. We establish and feed to our neural network additional relational information through radical embeddings we train using a skip-gram word2vec model.

                            This was my final project for <i>Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning (CS224N/LINGUIST284)</i>, which I took during winter 2017 at Stanford University. The course focused on neural network models for NLP, including question answering and machine translation.
