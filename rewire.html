                            Twenty years ago, Carol Dweck published her seminal study which suggested that students with a fixed mindset perform worse and underachieve as compared to students with a growth mindset. Growth mindset is the belief that intelligence and skills aren’t just innate, but can be grown through effort. Dweck’s research showed that teaching students about neuroplasticity, or the brain’s ability to change, is an effective way of instilling a growth mindset in students. This research has had profound impacts in the classroom. Teachers across the country are teaching their students about the malleable nature of the brain, and its ability to change based on experience. However, most current methods of teaching about growth mindset are highly instructionist, involving simply telling students about scientific experiments via a lecture. We wanted to create a more constructionist, hands-on approach towards learning about the brain, so that students can gain an intuitive understanding of how their brain grows and changes based on their effort. This led us to create the game <i><b>Rewire</b></i>.

                            The game features a character named “Muzu” who is trying to learn a skill, such as math. The player’s goal is to “rewire” the neurons in Muzu’s brain to create a strong neuron pathway from start to end, so that Muzu will learn. The game mechanics were inspired directly by actual principles from neuroscience, such as Hebbian learning and myelination. When Muzu is hard at work, her neurons will activate and strengthen neural connections, but if Muzu gives up and stops working, her neural pathways will get slower and weaker. The idea is that by seeing how Muzu’s focused effort actually changes her brain to make it stronger and faster, students will better understand that this also happens in their own brain! Initial learner feedback from our tests have shown that users not only engage deeply with neuroscience principles, but even discover new principles on their own throughout the game.

                            This was my final project for <i>Beyond Bits And Atoms: Designing Technological Tools (CS402/EDUC211)</i>, which I took during winter 2019 at Stanford University. The course focused on designing and prototyping educational technologies, with course material on both pedagogical frameworks as well as various fabrication techniques.

                        <p>
                            The project was done in partnership with another student in the course. My contributions included developing the game mechanics, graphic design, video and poster creation, and the bulk of the software engineering work.
