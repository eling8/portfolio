                        <h4>Developing Therapeutic Approaches to Neurodegenerative Diseases Associated with Defects in RNA-binding Proteins</h4>
                        <p><i>Emily Ling and Hye-Jean Yoon</i></p>
                        <p>
                            Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease with unknown cause. However, mutations in the RNA-binding proteins, Fused in sarcoma/Translated in liposarcoma (FUS) and TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDA (TDP-43), have been identified in ALS patients. Drosophila flies expressing FUS and TDP-43 proteins in ommatidia and motor neurons were used as a Drosophila model of ALS. Flies were treated with 1 mg/ml of the antioxidants Vitamin C and Vitamin E, and the over-the-counter drugs Cimetidine and Naproxen. Naproxen was toxic to larvae at 1 mg/ml, but the other three drug treatments did slow down disease progression. In flies expressing TDP-43 and FUS proteins in motor neurons, treatment with Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and Cimetidine improved the larval movement index (number of peristaltic contractions in a two-minute interval) as compared to the control; however, this difference was not significant. Transgenic flies expressing wild-type TDP-43 protein in the ommatidia showed improvement after drug treatment, though this difference was not significant. Transgenic flies expressing wild-type FUS, mutant P525L FUS proteins, or mutant A315T TDP proteins in the ommatidia showed statistically significant improvement when treated with any of the three drugs. Thus, antioxidants may be potential treatments for ALS.

                            The purpose of this investigation was to study mitochondrial protectors as potential therapies for Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and other neurodegenerative diseases associated with mutations in the RNA-binding proteins, Fused in sarcoma/Translated in liposarcoma (FUS) and TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDA (TDP-43). For ease of observation, this investigation used transgenic Drosophila expressing mutant FUS and TDP-43 proteins in the ommatidia of the eye. Flies were treated with food containing 5 and 10 mM of the compounds Necrostatin-1, N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), Guanabenz (GBZ), and Tacrine. The eye phenotype was observed at regular intervals using a set of criteria evaluating level of degeneration. Tacrine and Necrostatin-1 were toxic to larvae, but the other two drug treatments affected disease progression. Compared to the control, NAC and GBZ significantly improved the pupae formation, eclosion, and survival rates of the transgenic flies. In flies expressing mutant FUS proteins, NAC improved the eye phenotype compared to GBZ (p<0.05). Flies treated with 10 mM of NAC or GBZ often showed more severe eye phenotypes than those treated with 5 µM, suggesting that excessive dosages may worsen symptoms. Although further investigation is needed, NAC and GBZ may be potential therapies for ALS and related diseases.

                        <h4>Using Microfluidic Chambers to Evaluate the Effect of MitoQ on FUS-mediated Neurotoxicity</h4>
                        <p><i>Emily Ling</i></p>
                        <p>
                            The purpose of this investigation was to study MitoQ as a potential treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and other neurodegenerative diseases associated with mutations in the RNA-binding protein, Fused in sarcoma/Translated in liposarcoma (FUS). Cortical neurons were isolated from day 18 rat embryos and transfected with control, wild-type FUS, and P525L mutant FUS plasmids. Neurons were plated in microfluidic chambers, which are specially-designed devices that use microgrooves to organize axon growth. They were then treated with 0.1 µM, 0.3 µM, or 0.5 µM MitoQ, or the control. The neurons were fixed and stained after one week, and were imaged using a fluorescent microscope. 0.3 µM and 0.5 µM MitoQ treatments were toxic, so only the control and 0.1 µM MitoQ treatments were analyzed. Mitochondrial fragmentation, dendrite length, and branch point number were observed and quantified. The results showed that FUS transfections significantly worsened mitochondrial fragmentation, as expected (p<0.0001). However, MitoQ treatment significantly worsened all three aspects of neuronal health (p<0.05). This unexpected result is likely due to toxic byproducts in the MitoQ, which may not have been sufficiently purified during production. Despite these results, MitoQ may still be a promising therapy for ALS, and further investigation is suggested.
