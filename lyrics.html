                        <p>
                            The goal of this project was to generate song lyrics in the style of a particular artist, based on a theme or topic. There were two major aspects of the project for our task. The first was figuring out how to cluster songs in such a way that cohesive themes would arise. The second was using AI techniques to generate lyrics in the style of the artist.

                        <h4>Details</h4>
                        <p>
                            Our work included the following tasks:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Created a lyrics dataset.</b> We collected lyrics from azlyrics.com of approximately 120 popular artists, with a total of over 6000 songs.</li>
                            <li><b>Used K-means clustering on song lyrics to create groups of songs with similar ideas.</b> We first extract nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs from each song and use the NLTK Snowball stemmer to stem them. Counts of these words are transformed into a vector representation of each song. For each artist, we create a song-word count matrix, which is first normalized using TF-IDF with add-one smoothing and then dimensionality reduced using Truncated SVD. Then, we use k-means clustering with three clusters identify groups of similar theme. Each cluster is identified by the most common words in that cluster, excluding stopwords.</li>
                            <li><b>Used an N-gram Markov model to generate lyrics.</b>The user selects an artist and a theme, and our model will generate a song consisting of two verses, a chorus, and a bridge. Our model uses unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams to generate lyrics one word at a time; the n-gram count comes from songs by the selected artist in the selected theme cluster.</li>
                            <li><b>Epsilon random word generation.</b> At a small probability (20%), the lyrics generator would randomly select a word from the full corpus of all songs rather than only words used previously by the artist, in order to expand the vocabulary.</li>
                            <li><b>Evaluated the quality of our generated lyrics using a rubric.</b> The rubric asked for numerical ratings from 1 to 5 in two broad categories: 1. Artist and theme fidelity, and 2. Song fluency. We also asked responders to decide whether a given song was real or generated. We conducted 34 surveys, presenting each responder with either a real or generated song from one of five popular artists. We found that the primary weaknesses in our generated lyrics were grammatical correctness, fluency, and cohesion.</li>

                            This was my final project for <i>Artificial Intelligence: Principles and Techniques (CS221)</i>, which I took during fall 2015 at Stanford University. The course introduced a variety of concepts in artificial intelligence, including search, constraint satisfaction, game playing, Markov decision processes, graphical models, machine learning, and logic. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The project was done in partnership with two other students in the course. The work was divided equally.
